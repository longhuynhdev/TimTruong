1. Install `pnpm` (Package Manager) if it's not already installed on your machine.
    Visit: https://pnpm.io/installation for installation instructions.

2. Navigate to the client directory and install dependencies by running these commands:
```shell
cd client
pnpm install
```

3. Start the development server:
```shell
pnpm run dev
```
This will launch the frontend application in development mode. The server typically starts at `http://localhost:5173`.
